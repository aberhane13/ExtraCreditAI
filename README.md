# ExtraCreditAI
Extra credit project for Artificial Intelligence course written in Java. After entering the instructed input, it visualizes all the possible tragectories of a chess piece from a starting location to a destination in a chess board.

## About Shortest Tragectories in an abstract board game
For a more in depth look at how shortest tragectories work in an abstract board game, look at the ShortestTragectoriesInABG.pdf file. I followed the instructions in this file when writing my program.

## IDE used to run project
I used the Eclipse IDE

## Files

### ChessPiece.java
Contains the class for the chess piece

### StdDraw.java
Open source drawing library used to visualize the chess board and tragectories

### driver.java
File that runs the program. It also contains the methods for mapping, drawing the board, finding the sum of the tragectories, and finding the shortest tragectories.

##Instructions
Further instructions on how to use the program, as well as sample output, can be found in the finalProjectReadMe.docx file.
